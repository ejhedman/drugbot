Looking at your outline, you have a solid foundation for a generic app skeleton. Let me help you refine the requirements to make them more complete and actionable for an AI app builder. Here are the areas that need clarification and expansion:
Gaps and Clarifications Needed:
1. Data Structure & Relationships

Entity Properties: You mention "entity_property1" and "child_entity_property1" - should these be configurable fields that users can define, or fixed properties?
Relationship Cardinality: Is this always one-to-many (entity â†’ children), or should it support many-to-many relationships?
Data Validation: What validation rules should apply to entity names, properties, and relationships?

2. User Interactions & CRUD Operations

Adding Entities: When clicking the square-plus icon, what form fields should appear? How are entity properties defined?
Editing: How do users edit existing entities/children? Click-to-edit, dedicated edit buttons, or modal forms?
Deletion: How do users delete entities/children? What happens to orphaned children when parent entities are deleted?
Bulk Operations: Should users be able to select multiple items for bulk actions?

3. Content Detail Panel Specifications

Card Layout: You mention "one or more cards" - what determines how many cards and what content goes in each?
Entity vs Child Display: Should entity detail and child detail have different layouts/fields?
Interactive Elements: Should the detail panel be read-only or allow inline editing?

4. UI/UX Specifics

Column Widths: What should be the relative widths of content-list-1, content-list-2, and content-detail?
Responsive Behavior: How should the layout adapt on mobile/tablet screens?
Loading States: How should the app handle loading states when switching between entities?
Empty States: What should display when lists are empty or no entity is selected?

5. Search & Filtering

Search Scope: Should search work on entity names only, or include properties?
Search Behavior: Real-time filtering as user types, or search-on-enter?
Advanced Filtering: Should users be able to filter by properties or other criteria?

6. Technical Architecture

File Structure: What should the Next.js project structure look like (pages vs app router)?
State Management: How should client-side state be managed (React Context, Zustand, etc.)?
API Endpoints: What REST endpoints should be created for CRUD operations?
Error Handling: How should the app handle data loading errors or validation failures?

7. Authentication Simulation

Hardcoded Credential: What specific email should be used? Should there be multiple test users?
Session Persistence: Should login state persist across browser refreshes?
Login Form: What fields should the login form contain?

Questions for You:

Generic vs Specific: Should this skeleton support any entity type with configurable properties, or is it specifically for the entity/children relationship you described?
Data Export/Import: Should users be able to export their data or import additional datasets?
Visual Design: Any specific color scheme, branding, or visual style preferences beyond Tailwind/shadcn defaults?
Performance: Any expectations around handling large datasets (hundreds/thousands of entities)?
Browser Support: Any specific browser compatibility requirements?

Once you clarify these points, I can help you create a comprehensive requirements document that an AI app builder can work from effectively.
